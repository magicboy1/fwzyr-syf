You are Vibe Code. build a production-ready real-time quiz web app for a live event.

Project name: fawazeer-seif
Product name (Arabic): فوازير سيف
Product name (English): Fawazeer Seif

Goal
- create a Kahoot-like live quiz experience
- big screen shows questions and results
- players join via QR and answer on their phones
- host controls the game
- include ONLY these extra hype features (do not add more game mechanics):
  1) one randomly selected “double points” question per game (announced)
  2) speed streak bonus (3 correct in a row) with on-screen callout
  3) final statistics screen after the game

Must be extremely smooth, minimal, and “premium” in UX with elegant animations and event-style visuals.

Branding / visual direction (match the attached reference image style)
- theme: deep navy background + premium gold gradients
- vibe: formal, elegant, annual suhoor event
- avoid bright neon colors, avoid playful cartoon style
- use subtle gold glow, soft shadows, and calm transitions
- typography: Arabic + English support. use a clean Arabic font (like IBM Plex Sans Arabic if available) and a clean Latin font.
- keep layout spacious, aligned, balanced
- create a consistent design system (tokens) for colors, spacing, radius, shadows, and typography

Key screens
A) Big Screen (Audience Display)
- lobby screen with QR + Game PIN + live player count + list/avatars of latest joiners
- question screen with:
  - question number + question text
  - countdown timer (progress bar + seconds)
  - do NOT show answer text on the big screen (show only colored option shapes A/B/C/D)
- after-question reveal screen:
  - show distribution of chosen answers in percentages (bar chart)
  - reveal correct option
  - show top 3 fastest correct players
  - show top 5 leaderboard (with movement indicator up/down)
- end of game:
  - winner podium (top 3)
  - final stats (see details below)
  - celebratory confetti animation

B) Player Mobile Web
- join flow:
  - enter Game PIN or scan QR deep link with PIN prefilled
  - enter display name
  - waiting screen with game title and status
- answering:
  - show 4 big buttons (A/B/C/D) with colors and large tap areas
  - once selected, lock answer and show “answer received”
- feedback after each question:
  - show correct/incorrect
  - show points gained this question
  - show current rank (or approximate rank if needed for performance)
- keep everything mobile-first and super responsive

C) Host Controller
- create a new session (generates PIN)
- load question set (from built-in sample + CSV import)
- set time per question (global default + per question override)
- start game, next question, reveal answers, show leaderboard, end game
- ability to pause/resume
- ability to kick a player (optional)
- ability to restart game with same questions (fresh scores)

D) Admin / Question Management
- CRUD questions in the browser
- import CSV and export JSON
- question fields:
  - question text (Arabic/English allowed)
  - 4 options (text)
  - correct option (A/B/C/D)
  - optional: category/tag
- IMPORTANT: The big screen must not show option text, but the player screen must show it.

Game mechanics
- Standard question scoring:
  - correct = 1000 points
  - speed bonus up to 300 points based on remaining time (linear)
  - incorrect = 0
  - no negative points
- Exactly ONE randomly selected “double points” question per game:
  - randomly pick at game start from among all questions (if at least 3 questions exist)
  - announce on big screen before that question starts: “double points question”
  - scoring is multiplied by 2 for that question (including speed bonus)
- Speed streak:
  - if player gets 3 correct answers in a row, grant +500 bonus immediately after the 3rd correct answer
  - show big-screen callout like: “{playerName} on fire 🔥”
  - streak resets on incorrect or unanswered
- Unanswered:
  - if player does not submit before timer ends: 0 points and streak reset

End-of-game Final Statistics (must be implemented)
- show:
  - fastest correct answer overall (player name + time)
  - best streak (player name + streak length)
  - hardest question (lowest % correct)
  - average response time
  - participation rate (% of players who answered most questions)
- These stats should be computed from the full game data stored during the session

Realtime & sync requirements
- Must use websockets (Socket.io recommended) to sync:
  - current game state across big screen, host, and players
  - question timers must be authoritative on server
  - handle reconnect: player can refresh and continue (session + player id stored in localStorage)
- State machine approach: LOBBY -> QUESTION -> REVEAL -> LEADERBOARD -> (repeat) -> END
- Timer:
  - server starts timer and sends start timestamp + duration
  - clients render with local countdown derived from server time
  - ensure drift is minimized (periodic server time sync)

Tech stack (preferred)
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Backend: Node/Next server with Socket.io (or a separate Node server)
- Storage:
  - in-memory per session is ok for MVP
  - also implement optional persistence to a JSON file (server-side) for saving a game report after ending
- Charts:
  - use a lightweight chart component for answer distribution (simple bars)
- Animations:
  - framer-motion for transitions
- QR:
  - generate QR code on lobby big screen with join link: /join?pin=XXXX

Non-functional requirements
- Works well on:
  - big screen 16:9 (1920x1080)
  - mobile phones (iOS/Android)
  - host on laptop
- handles 500 concurrent players in one session reliably
- prioritize performance and stable connections
- security:
  - host has a secret host key (random token) to prevent others controlling the game
  - sanitize all user inputs (names)
- accessibility:
  - high contrast, large tap targets, avoid tiny text on mobile
- i18n:
  - UI supports Arabic and English
  - for Arabic, apply RTL on player and big screen where appropriate

Deliverables
- complete codebase with clear folder structure
- run scripts:
  - dev
  - build
  - start
- README with:
  - setup steps
  - how to run locally
  - how to deploy
  - CSV import format
- include a sample question set in Arabic and English
- ensure consistent premium theme matching the provided branding style

Important constraints
- do not add extra game modes or extra mechanics beyond those specified
- do not show option text on the big screen
- keep UX clean and premium, not playful
- ensure correctness of scoring and stats
